# Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization

This is a repository for the Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization. It contains notes, code examples, and projects that I have compiled during my studies.

## Course Content

This specialization covers the following main areas:

*   **Linear Algebra**: Vectors, matrices, linear transformations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, etc.
*   **Calculus**: Derivatives, partial derivatives, gradients, multivariable calculus, optimization, etc.
*   **Probability and Statistics**: Probability distributions, random variables, expected value, variance, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, etc.
*   **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction technique.
*   **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Classification algorithm.
*   **Neural Networks Basics**: Perceptron, backpropagation, etc.
